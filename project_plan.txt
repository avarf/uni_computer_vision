crop and resize picture to standard size =>
calculate the gradient image( we can do this by using soble filter two times with kernel size of "1" and save the result) =>
calculate the magnitude and orientation of the gradient(
mag, angle = cv2.cartToPolar(gx, gy, angleInDegrees=True)
) =>
calculate HOG in 8*8 cells
